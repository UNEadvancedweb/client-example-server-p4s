    <p>
        This page plays Fizz-Buzz from
        a <a href="javascript/fizzbuzz.js">linked script</a>.
        It uses an ordered list so you can see which number it's up to.

        Of course, the page is really here just to show the server is serving
        up html and javascript ok, so you can install examples into it.
